# Overview
***
This is a hangman application that has a few words pre-written which will be converted to a string of underscores. The user is then prompted to enter a letter, and the program makes sure that the user input is correct (a valid char). The user has 6 attempts to guess the hidden word after which, the program terminates with ether a success message, or revealing what the original word was.
